    "#AI Estimator\n",

    "This code is a proof of concept intended larger project that aims to assist with property management tasks. It is designed to help with the estimation of materials needed for a roofing job. It takes into account various factors such as the size and shape of the roof, the type of materials being used, and the specific requirements of the job.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "The code uses the OpenAI API to interact with the user and perform tasks based on the user's input. It can create estimates for property renovations or repairs, retrieve property owner details from the database, retrieve property information from the database, retrieve building structure information from the database, and retrieve materials templates from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is organized into several classes and functions, each with a specific role. For example, the `SupportedTrade` and `RequiredRoofingMaterials` classes define the types of jobs and materials that the calculator can handle. The `Material` class represents a specific type of material, including its name, role, how many units are in a package, the cost per unit, and a waste factor to account for any material that might be wasted during the job.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `RoofInputMeasurements` class represents the measurements of the roof, including the length and width of the area, the total length of the roof area, and specific measurements for different parts of the roof like ridges, valleys, rakes, etc. The `RoofingSettings` class represents the assumptions for a roofing calculator, like how many shingles are needed per square foot of roof, how many nails are needed per square foot, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MaterialTemplate` class represents a template for a specific brand of materials, including the name of the template, a list of materials, and the roofing settings. The `LineItem` class represents a line item in the estimate, including the material needed, the number of packages needed, and the cost per package. The `MaterialList` class represents a list of materials needed for a roofing job, including the trade (roofing) and a list of line items.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the `RoofEstimate` class is the main part of the calculator. It takes in the required roles of materials, the measurements of the roof, and the material templates. It then validates the templates, calculates the quantity and cost of each material, and generates an estimate of the materials needed for the job.\n",
    "\n",
    "##AI Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Uses Langchain's `ChatOpenAI` Agent and tool decorators to provide the above calculations to the Agent. Examples are provided showing how the data is supposed to flow and a hardcoded example given a single full property."
